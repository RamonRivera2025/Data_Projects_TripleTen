# Data_Projects_TripleTen
During my time at TripleTen Bootcamp, I worked on hands-on projects that strengthened my skills in data analytics and visualization. Here are a few highlights!
| Project Name | Description & Tools Used |
|--------------|-------------------------|
|Fresh Beats User Data| Investigated user patterns & genre trends to suggest content promotion strategies & retention tactics. Analyzed user activity data to identify trends, preferences, & patterns. Segmented users based on engagement, activity frequency, or demographics.  Created visualizations to communicate key findings effectively to stakeholders|
|NYC_airbnb_data| Explored the NYC Airbnb dataset to identify key trends & patterns. Created visualizations & dashboards to communicate findings clearly to stakeholders |
|Business Analytic Project| Analyzed real-world business problems using data-driven methods.  The project focused on simulating how analysts work with cross-functional teams to identify patterns, diagnose issues, & make recommendations that improve operations or drive business growth while using e-commerce data to create funnels & cohort analysis|
|Data Visualization With Tableau|Applied data visualization techniques using Tableau to transform raw datasets into meaningful business insights while                     reviewing the superstoreâ€™s operations & increasing its profitability to avoid bankruptcy. I used calculated fields, parameters, & filters to enhance interactivity. Designed multiple visualizations (bar charts, line charts, maps) tailored to business questions & built an interactive dashboard with drop-down capabilities & user filters|
| Story Telling With Data| Used Tableau to tell a compelling data story. The goal was to combine data analysis with best practices in visualization to                  clearly & persuasively communicate insights to stakeholders regarding return rates. I conducted a general analysis of the Superstore data that showed which items were returned the most. I created a story with scatterplots, bar charts, & map visualizations so executives not only learned about the findings, but were able to interactively test different situations. I submitted a screen-recorded presentation documenting the final results|
|Power BI| Analyzed data from Shopify's websites, which included app ratings, downloads, reviews, pricing & other metrics to identify which factors contributed to an apps success|
