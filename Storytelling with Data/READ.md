# Storytelling with Data
### Description
_Used Tableau to tell a compelling data story. The goal was to combine data analysis with best practices in visualizations to clearly and persuasively communicate insights to stakeholders regarding return rates_
- Conducted a general analysis of the Superstore data that showed what kinds of items were returned the most
  
### Results
_Created a Tableau story that would allow an executive to learn about findings while changing parameters in an interactive way to test different situations_
- Provided findings by creating scatterplots, bar charts, and map visualizations
- Submitted a screen-recorded presentation with final results

  ### Findings 
  - The West region produced the highest amount of returns
  - The top 3 states with the highest return rates: Utah, Oregon, and California
  - The top 3 Subcategories for returns: Appliances, Fasteners, and Machines
  - The top 3 months with the highest return rates: September, August, and December

### Insights
_Provided the Superstore's team with meaningful data to help better understand return rates based on different factors_
- Concluded that most returns were happening during seasonal months, leading executives to understand that the seasonal trend will more than likely occur each year
